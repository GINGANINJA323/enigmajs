# EnigmaJS - WWII Encryption

This is a website that allows you to convert plaintext into Enigma ciphertext, based on your own machine configuration.

Currently tested and working with default settings, for short messages (haven't checked the rotors fully).

Steps to run:

1. `npm install` to get the packages. Node v16+ recommended.
2. `npm start` to run it.
3. Profit. Browser tab should open to the correct address.

Steps to use:

1. Enter some text in the text entry.
2. If desired, use the 'Plugboard', 'Rotors' and 'Reflector Mode' buttons to configure the machine.
3. Press 'Encrypt!', and your ciphertext will be printed on screen.
4. Replace the plaintext with the cipertext, or send the machine config and ciphertext to a friend, press 'Encrypt!' and your plaintext should come back out!
